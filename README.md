# Currency Converter
This script reads data from a text file named CurrentData.txt that contains currency conversion rates and converts an input amount from INR (Indian Rupee) to the user-specified currency. The available currency options and their conversion rates are displayed on the console for the user to choose from.

To use the script, simply run the code and input the amount you want to convert and the currency you want to convert it to. The output will show the converted amount in the specified currency, along with the date of the last update for the currency rates used.

Note: The currency rates used in the script may not be up-to-date, so the converted amounts should be used as estimates only.
